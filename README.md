2023 ADRC Neuropathology Brain Region & Staining Survey Analysis

Analysis done by Juan Carlos (JC) Vizcarra

Collaborators that spearheaded the survey & survey analysis: Dr. Andrew F. Teich, Dr. Davis A. Gutman, Dr. Brittany N. Dugger.

Additonal acknowledgments: ADRC digital pathology working group, Dr. Jonathan D. Glass, Dr. Marla Gearing, Dr. Katherine L. Lucot, and Kevin Nzenkue.

In 2022 a survey was sent out to 40 ADRC, brain banks, or former ADRC contacts. Questions focused on neuropathology practice, especially the immunohistochemistry procedures followed, the region sampling and the staining for the regions. This repo contains a programming script (Python version >=3) that analyzes the results (excel file) and creates figures and text files for reporting.

The results of this analysis are being included in a manuscript to be published in the near future.

Use the Jupyter notebook analysis.py to re-create figures and result files.

Python requirements:
- pandas
- matplotlib
- numpy
